# LAP 3 Code Challenge

> Repo Tracker created using React (Coding Challenge for Lap 3 at futureproof)

We are on GitHub a **lot**! Let's make our own repo tracker so we can get an overview of our work without visiting the site itself.

Base your design aesthetic on a minimalist version of a GitHub [repositories page](https://github.com/getfutureproof?tab=repositories).

You will be working in pairs for this challenge and teaming up with another pair to give feedback via PR review.

## Requirements
- Your app should make use of React
- Your repo tracker should have an input for users to give their GitHub username
- After submitting their username, use the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-repositories-for-a-user) to retrieve that user's list of repos
- When selecting a repo, a User should be shown some data about that repo eg. issue count, stargazers, forks etc.

***NB: This usage of the GitHub API does not require authentication***

## Timeline
- Tuesday PM & Wednesday AM: Work on challenge in pairs

### Wednesday
- 1pm: It's lunchtime! All work to have been pushed to a GitHub repo with review requested from another pair.
- 2pm: Review the request sent to you by the other pair
- 3pm: Meet with the other pair to discuss the comments that have been made.
- 4pm: Take your feedback and use it to implement any changes and improvements.

## Tips
- Create a new repo on GitHub early and push a basic README.md
- Very early on, before you've pushed any more code to GitHub, [make a new branch on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) called review/feedback/free-beer, whatever you like. Don’t push or merge anything to it, we’ll use it tomorrow for review purposes.
- When you find out who your review partners are, [add them as collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
- When ready to submit for review, make all final commits and push to your working branch
- Make a Pull Request ***to*** your review branch, ***from*** your working branch
- **Do not** merge this PR!
- Request review on your PR by adding your review partners as reviewers by clicking the cog next to 'Reviewers' on the pull request page
- Keep an eye out in your own email and/or [GitHub notifications](https://github.com/notifications?query=reason%3Areview-requested) to see when you have been requested to review another team's work!
